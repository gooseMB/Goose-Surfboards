What began as fixing and painting surfboards in his parents garage in middle school, turned into a full-time career for Josh “Goose” Stern in 2013. Fortunate to get a job at one of the largest surfboard manufacturing factories in Los Angeles, he worked his way up from sweeping up the shop, to fin boxes, to eventually becoming proficient in all stages of surfboard building. While learning, studying, and watching some of the best shapers in the world,  Goose has built almost every type of surfboard, from ultra-high performance shortboards, to classic twin fins, traditional longboards, and every other alternative style of wave gliding. 
<br>This experience working full time in glass shops has helped shape what Surfboards by Goose has become today, 10 years ongoing of daily research and collaborative learning and experimenting. Goose lives, breathes, and dreams surfboard building. He lives amongst the dust and resin, and reveals in the non-stop push to create an even better surfboard, every day. 
<br>Surfboards by Goose is his tried and true models, designed for the every day surfer to maximize their stoke levels. Goose specializes in working one-on-one with his customers, creating a surfboard meant for their specific style. 
<br>Currently, Goose works at Mangiagli Manufacturing in Hermosa Beach, California. You can find him there on any given day, shaping, sanding, glassing-on fins, or whatever else might come up around the factory. Surfboards by Goose are shaped and glassed by hand, start-to-finish with an highly tuned focus on the details, using only the best materials available.
<br><br>Stay stoked. Go surfing.
